# Textbook for Teaching Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Course Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Foundational & Modular Content
The textbook must be structured in a modular way, starting with foundational concepts and building up to more complex topics. This allows for flexible course design and easy integration of new material.

### II. Practical Application Focus
Every theoretical concept must be accompanied by practical examples, labs, or simulations that can be implemented with real or simulated robots. This ensures students gain hands-on experience.

### III. Rigorous & Up-to-Date Content
The content must be technically accurate, peer-reviewed, and regularly updated to reflect the latest advancements in AI and robotics. A clear process for content review and updates is mandatory.

### IV. Clear & Accessible Language
The textbook must be written in clear, concise language, avoiding unnecessary jargon to be accessible to students from diverse backgrounds. All acronyms and specialized terms must be clearly defined.

### V. Interactive Learning
The textbook must include interactive elements like quizzes, exercises, and links to online resources to enhance the learning experience and reinforce concepts.

### VI. Open & Extensible
The textbook is open to community contributions and extensions. A clear and transparent process for submitting, reviewing, and integrating new content is required to foster collaboration and ensure quality.

## Content Structure

The textbook is organized into distinct parts, each covering a major area of Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics. Each part consists of modules, and each module contains chapters. This modular structure allows instructors to customize the curriculum and enables parallel development of content.

## Contribution & Review Process

All contributions, from minor typo fixes to new chapters, are welcome. Submissions are made via pull requests and must undergo a peer-review process. At least two approvals from designated reviewers are required before a contribution is merged. All contributions must adhere to the principles outlined in this constitution.

## Governance

This constitution is the supreme governing document for the project. All content, contributions, and development practices must comply with its principles. Amendments to this constitution require a formal proposal, a community discussion period, and a majority vote from the project maintainers.
