# API Contracts

For the "Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Course Book" project, which is a static Docusaurus website hosted on GitHub Pages, there are no traditional backend API contracts in the typical sense (e.g., REST or GraphQL endpoints).

The "API" of this project consists of:
*   **Static Assets**: The HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and image files generated by Docusaurus.
*   **Analytics Integration**: Client-side JavaScript interactions with the chosen web analytics provider (Google Analytics GA4). The "contract" here is defined by the GA4 measurement protocol/client library.
*   **Feedback Form Integration**: If an embedded feedback form is used, its integration point (e.g., a third-party service endpoint or a serverless function) would constitute an external dependency with its own implicit contract. Details for this are to be determined during implementation.

Any content-related "API" is managed by the Markdown/MDX file format and the Docusaurus content processing pipeline.
