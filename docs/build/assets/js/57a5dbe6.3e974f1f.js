At its core, robotics is concerned with the design, construction, operation, and use of robots. AI, on the other hand, is the theory and development of computer systems able to perform tasks that normally require human intelligence. When these two fields converge, we get Physical AI, where intelligent algorithms are embodied in machines that can perceive, reason, and act upon the physical world.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"part1/chapter3":{"id":"part1/chapter3","title":"Chapter 3: Control Systems and Algorithms","description":"Control systems are at the heart of every robot, providing the link between perception and action. They are responsible for taking the high-level goals of the robot and translating them into low-level commands for the actuators. In this chapter, we will explore the fundamental concepts of control systems and the algorithms that are used to control robotic systems.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"part1/chapter4":{"id":"part1/chapter4","title":"Chapter 4: Basics of AI and Machine Learning for Robotics","description":"Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) are the core technologies that enable robots to perform intelligent tasks. In this chapter, we will provide a high-level overview of the fundamental concepts of AI and ML and their applications in robotics.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"part2/chapter5":{"id":"part2/chapter5","title":"Chapter 5: Computer Vision in Robotics","description":"Computer Vision is a field of artificial intelligence that enables computers and systems to derive meaningful information from digital images, videos, and other visual inputs \u2014 and take actions or make recommendations based on that information. For robots, computer vision is the primary sense that allows them to perceive and understand the world around them.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"part2/chapter6":{"id":"part2/chapter6","title":"Chapter 6: Reinforcement Learning for Physical AI","description":"Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a powerful paradigm in machine learning where an agent learns to make decisions by interacting with an environment. The agent learns to take actions that maximize a cumulative reward signal, without being explicitly told which actions to take. This makes RL particularly well-suited for robotics, where agents must learn to operate in complex, dynamic, and uncertain environments.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"part2/chapter7":{"id":"part2/chapter7","title":"Chapter 7: Neural Networks for Robotic Control","description":"Neural Networks are a class of machine learning models that are inspired by the structure and function of the human brain. They are composed of a large number of interconnected nodes, called neurons, which are organized into layers. Neural networks are particularly well-suited for tasks that involve learning complex patterns from data, such as image recognition, natural language processing, and control.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"part3/chapter10":{"id":"part3/chapter10","title":"Chapter 10: Robot Actuators and Sensors","description":"Actuators and sensors are the \\"muscles\\" and \\"senses\\" of a robot, respectively. They are the components that allow a robot to interact with its environment and to perceive the world around it. In this chapter, we will explore the different types of actuators and sensors that are used in robotics.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"part3/chapter11":{"id":"part3/chapter11","title":"Chapter 11: Robot Localization and Mapping","description":"For a robot to operate autonomously, it must be able to answer two fundamental questions: \\"Where am I?\\" and \\"What does the world around me look like?\\". The tasks of answering these questions are known as localization and mapping, respectively.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"part3/chapter8":{"id":"part3/chapter8","title":"Chapter 8: Robot Kinematics","description":"Robot kinematics is the study of the motion of robots without considering the forces that cause it. It is one of the most fundamental topics in robotics, as it provides the basis for understanding and controlling the movement of robots.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"part3/chapter9":{"id":"part3/chapter9","title":"Chapter 9: Robot Dynamics","description":"Robot dynamics is the study of the motion of robots considering the forces and torques that cause it. It is a more complex topic than robot kinematics, but it is essential for understanding and controlling the dynamic behavior of robots.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"part4/chapter12":{"id":"part4/chapter12","title":"Chapter 12: A Deep Dive into Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics","description":"In this chapter, we will take a deep dive into the exciting and rapidly evolving fields of Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics. We will explore the key concepts, challenges, and applications of these technologies, and we will discuss the future of intelligent robots that can interact with the physical world in a human-like way.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"part4/chapter13":{"id":"part4/chapter13","title":"Chapter 13: Human-Robot Interaction (HRI)","description":"Human-Robot Interaction (HRI) is a multidisciplinary field dedicated to understanding, designing, and evaluating robotic systems for use by or with humans. As Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics advance, the ability for robots to interact effectively, safely, and naturally with people becomes paramount.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"part4/chapter14":{"id":"part4/chapter14","title":"Chapter 14: Ethical and Societal Implications of Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics","description":"As Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics evolve from scientific curiosities to pervasive technologies, their ethical and societal implications become increasingly critical. These advanced systems, capable of autonomous physical action and human-like interaction, raise profound questions about responsibility, privacy, employment, and human dignity.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"}}}}')}}]);
