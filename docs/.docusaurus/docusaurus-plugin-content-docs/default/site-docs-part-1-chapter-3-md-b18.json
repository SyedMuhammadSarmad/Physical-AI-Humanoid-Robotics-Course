  "description": "Control systems are at the heart of every robot, providing the link between perception and action. They are responsible for taking the high-level goals of the robot and translating them into low-level commands for the actuators. In this chapter, we will explore the fundamental concepts of control systems and the algorithms that are used to control robotic systems.",
