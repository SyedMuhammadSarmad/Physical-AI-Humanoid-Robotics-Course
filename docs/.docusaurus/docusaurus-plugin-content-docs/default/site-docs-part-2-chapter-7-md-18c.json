  "description": "Neural Networks are a class of machine learning models that are inspired by the structure and function of the human brain. They are composed of a large number of interconnected nodes, called neurons, which are organized into layers. Neural networks are particularly well-suited for tasks that involve learning complex patterns from data, such as image recognition, natural language processing, and control.",
