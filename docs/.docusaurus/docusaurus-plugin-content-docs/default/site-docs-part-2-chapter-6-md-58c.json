  "description": "Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a powerful paradigm in machine learning where an agent learns to make decisions by interacting with an environment. The agent learns to take actions that maximize a cumulative reward signal, without being explicitly told which actions to take. This makes RL particularly well-suited for robotics, where agents must learn to operate in complex, dynamic, and uncertain environments.",
