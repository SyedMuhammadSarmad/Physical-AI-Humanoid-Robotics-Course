# Chapter 2: Introduction to Robotics and AI

The fields of Robotics and Artificial Intelligence (AI) have a deeply intertwined history. At its core, robotics is concerned with the design, construction, operation, and use of robots. AI, on the other hand, is the theory and development of computer systems able to perform tasks that normally require human intelligence. When these two fields converge, we get **Physical AI**, where intelligent algorithms are embodied in machines that can perceive, reason, and act upon the physical world.

## The Symbiotic Relationship

Robotics provides the physical embodiment for AI, allowing algorithms to move beyond the digital realm and interact with the real world. Conversely, AI provides the "brains" for robots, enabling them to perform tasks with a degree of autonomy and intelligence that would be impossible with traditional control systems alone.

### Key Components of a Robotic System

A typical robotic system consists of the following components:

*   **Sensors**: These are the robot's "senses," allowing it to perceive its environment. Common sensors include cameras (for vision), microphones (for sound), LiDAR (for distance measurement), and tactile sensors (for touch).
*   **Actuators**: These are the components that allow the robot to move and interact with its environment. Examples include motors, servos, and hydraulic or pneumatic systems.
*   **Control System**: This is the "brain" of the robot, which processes information from the sensors and sends commands to the actuators. In Physical AI, the control system is where the AI algorithms are executed.
*   **Power Source**: Robots require a power source, which can be a battery, a connection to the electrical grid, or another form of energy.

## The Role of AI in Modern Robotics

AI has revolutionized the field of robotics in several ways:

*   **Perception**: AI algorithms, particularly those from the field of computer vision, allow robots to "see" and understand their environment. This is crucial for tasks such as navigation, object recognition, and manipulation.
*   **Learning**: Machine learning, a subfield of AI, enables robots to learn from experience and adapt to new situations. This is in contrast to traditional robots that are programmed with a fixed set of instructions.
*   **Decision Making**: AI algorithms can be used to make high-level decisions about how a robot should behave. This allows robots to perform complex tasks in dynamic and uncertain environments.

In the following chapters, we will delve deeper into the specific AI techniques that are used to build intelligent robotic systems.
